# **Note**
This folder is a **Data Augmentation** folder and contains the following:

#### **code**  
The code folder stores all the code between data transformations in the data augmentation process.

#### **data**  
The data folder stores all the dataset files used for model training and model testing.

#### **data_decomposition**  
The data decomposition folder stores the three corresponding unstructured text corpora 𝑄ℎ, 𝑄𝑡 , 𝑄𝑠 after splitting the different datasets.

#### **data_generate folder**  
The data augmentation folder stores the augmented training sets obtained by performing data augmentation under different datasets.

#### **data_similarity**
 The data similarity folder stores the sequence of matched text pairs PirQ obtained after performing similar matching strategies on three unstructured text corpora 𝑄ℎ, 𝑄𝑡 , 𝑄𝑠.

#### **Similarity_match_framework**
The Similarity_match_framework folder stores the matching models used to perform the semantic similarity matching algorithm on three unstructured text corpora 𝑄ℎ, 𝑄𝑡 , 𝑄𝑠. The specific configuration information and the running environment will be in the README file under this folder.

To help you better reproduce the complete experiment, we have added a README to each model's file. The README describes in detail all the details from configuration to operation, please check the README.md file in the model folder for more information.
