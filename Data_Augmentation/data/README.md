# Note
This folder is the data folder, which stores the original data and the augmented data. 
The original data are: **NYT, NYT_star, WebNLG, WebNLG_star**; 
The **augmented data** are: **NYT_augmentation, NYT_star_augmentation, WebNLG_augmentation, WebNLG_star_augmentation**.
Each dataset contains four files: **dev_triples.json, rel2id.json, test_triples.json, train_triples.json**.

These four datasets will be applied to the **CasRel, OneRel, PRGC, SPN4RE,** and **TPLinker** models to validate the efficiency of the augmented data in helping to improve the model's extraction of triples.
